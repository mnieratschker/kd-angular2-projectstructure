# kd-angular2-projectstructure

This project will show some basic instructions to get a simple angular application up and running.
The following points will be looked upon in the presentation.

We will be creating the shell for small **TODO** application from scratch with the help of the Angular-CLI 

## What we are going to do:

1. Look up Angular-CLI [(on the webs)](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and install it 
2. Initialize a project with Angular-CLI
3. Start a webserver
4. Create a **todo-list** component with Angular-CLI
0. Use component to display data
    * Maybe a second component or a service or something? No Problem!
    * Also run unit tests!!
0. Use service in component
    * Short detour into how to use dependency injection
    * Create data in service 
0. Create a **todo-detail** component in a second project
    * Switch to [kd-angular2-components](https://github.com/mnieratschker/kd-angular2-components)
0. Get components from external project
0. Use todo-detail component

### Extra

1. Run Tests with/without watches
0. Build Project for production 

## What is finished:
